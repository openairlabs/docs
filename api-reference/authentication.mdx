# API Authentication

<Callout type="warning">
**Secure Your API Keys** - Treat your API keys like passwords. Never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Callout>

The Flyweel API uses **API key authentication** with Bearer tokens to ensure secure access to your SpendOps data. This guide covers how to obtain, manage, and use your API credentials safely.

## Authentication Method

All API requests must include a valid API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Getting Your API Key

During the beta phase, API keys are provided upon approval:

1. **Request Access** - Email [api@flyweel.co](mailto:api@flyweel.co)
2. **Account Verification** - Confirm your active Flyweel subscription
3. **Use Case Review** - Describe your integration requirements
4. **Key Provision** - Receive your unique API key via secure channel

## Using Your API Key

### Example Request

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_abc123..." \
     https://api.flyweel.co/v1/campaigns
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Environment Variables** - Store keys in environment variables, never in code
- **Secure Storage** - Use secure credential management systems
- **Regular Rotation** - Rotate keys periodically for enhanced security
- **Monitor Usage** - Review API usage logs regularly

## Rate Limiting

API keys are subject to rate limits:
- **100 requests per minute**
- **1,000 requests per hour**

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 99
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors

**401 Unauthorized**
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
```

**403 Forbidden**
```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden", 
  "message": "API key does not have required permissions"
}
```
