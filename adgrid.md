# AdGrid

The AdGrid is your central hub for viewing, analyzing, and managing all of your ad campaigns from connected platforms.

## AdGrid Dashboard

The AdGrid dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your campaign data. It consists of two main parts:

*   **Campaign Metrics:** A high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) for your filtered campaigns.
*   **Campaigns List:** A detailed table of your campaigns, with customizable columns and sorting options.

## Filtering Your Data

The AdGrid includes a powerful set of filters to help you drill down into your data and find the insights you need. You can access the filters by clicking the **Filter** button in the top right of the Campaigns List card.

### Filter Options

*   **Date Range:** Select a specific time period to analyze. You can choose from preset ranges (e.g., Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days) or select a custom date range.
*   **Platforms:** Filter by ad platform (e.g., Google Ads, Meta Ads).
*   **Statuses:** Filter by campaign status (e.g., Active, Paused, Ended).
*   **Ad Accounts:** Select specific ad accounts to include in your analysis.
*   **Campaigns:** Choose individual campaigns to focus on.
*   **Metric Filters:** Apply advanced filters based on campaign performance. For example, you can filter for campaigns with a Click-Through Rate (CTR) greater than 2% or a Cost Per Click (CPC) less than $1.50.

## Customizing Your View

### Custom Metrics

In addition to the standard metrics provided by the ad platforms, you can create your own custom metrics to track the KPIs that matter most to your business.

1.  Click the **Filter** button.
2.  In the filter sidebar, you can manage your custom metrics.

### Campaign List

*   **Customize Columns:** You can choose which metric columns to display in the Campaigns List.
*   **Sort Data:** Click on any column header to sort the table by that metric.
