# Reports

The Reports page provides a high-level, visual overview of your campaign performance across all connected platforms. It's designed to help you quickly identify trends and understand the overall health of your advertising efforts.

## Dashboard Metrics

At the top of the page, you'll find a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) that summarize the performance of your campaigns based on the current filters.

## Performance Charts

The main body of the Reports page consists of several charts that visualize your data from different angles:

*   **Performance by Platform:** This chart compares the performance of your campaigns on Google Ads vs. Meta Ads, helping you understand which platform is driving the best results.
*   **Campaign Status:** This chart shows a breakdown of your campaigns by their current status (e.g., Active, Paused, Ended).
*   **Performance Over Time:** This chart visualizes key metrics (such as spend, impressions, and clicks) over the selected date range, allowing you to spot trends and patterns.

## Customizing Your View

You have several options to customize the layout and appearance of your reports dashboard:

*   **Layout:** Choose from different chart layouts to arrange the visualizations in a way that best suits your needs.
*   **Density:** Adjust the density of the dashboard to show more or less information in the same amount of space. Choose between Comfortable, Cozy, or Compact.

## Filtering Your Data

You can use the filters to control which data is included in your reports. The available filters include:

*   **Date Range:** Analyze a specific time period.
*   **Platform:** Focus on Google Ads, Meta Ads, or both.
*   **Campaign Status:** View data for active, paused, or ended campaigns.

## Auto-Refresh

The Reports page supports auto-refresh. You can enable this feature to have your dashboard data automatically updated at a specified interval, ensuring you're always looking at the latest information.
